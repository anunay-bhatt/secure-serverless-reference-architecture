# Demo Serverless App - Vulnerability management system (VMS)

This repo contains Terraform AWS configuration for deploying a demo serverless application.

VMS is a Vulnerability API service which provides secure API based access to the vulnerability database which is generated by threat monitoring services like Nessus, CloudAware, etc. The customers of VMS are the authenticated clients which want to get easy access to their vulnerabilities and its related metadata. Admin customers like threat monitoring services create the vulnerability data and post it to VMS.
